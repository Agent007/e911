Find the nearest people, within a configurable radius, to help you with your emergency. Those nearby 
will receive an SMS and reply with a text message if they can help you, which will then initiate an 
anonymized phone call between the helper ("good samaritan") and the person needing help. 

Future extension(s): Add audio and/or video conferencing (possibly with SkypeKit, which is in limited 
beta). This could evolve into a system that meets the FCC's requirements for an enhanced 911 system.
